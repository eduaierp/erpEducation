Here’s a detailed `README.md` for your `faculty-service`, modeled after the `attendance-service` format we used earlier. It includes module overview, tech stack, installation steps, DB setup, gRPC usage with Postman, and dev tips.

# 🧑‍🏫 Faculty Service - eduErp

The **Faculty Service** is a microservice in the `eduErp` system responsible for managing faculty members, including creation, retrieval, updating, deletion, and listing.

## 📦 Module Overview

| Feature         | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Create Faculty  | Add a new faculty member to the system           |
| Get Faculty     | Retrieve a faculty record by ID                  |
| Update Faculty  | Modify existing faculty details                  |
| Delete Faculty  | Remove a faculty record by ID                    |
| List Faculties  | Retrieve all faculty members                     |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Protocol**: gRPC
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Dependencies**:
  - `google.golang.org/grpc`
  - `github.com/lib/pq`

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Go 1.18+
- PostgreSQL running locally
- `protoc` (Protocol Buffers compiler)
- Postman (for gRPC testing)

### 🧪 Local Database Setup

1. Connect to PostgreSQL and create the `faculties` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE faculties (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    department TEXT NOT NULL,
    designation TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

2. Grant privileges (if needed):

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO ravikigf;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO ravikigf;
```

---

### 🏁 Start the gRPC Server

```bash
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

This starts the service on port `:50053`.

---

## 📡 gRPC API Endpoints

**Base URL:** `localhost:50053`  
**Proto File:** [`proto/faculty.proto`](proto/faculty.proto)

| Method          | Request Message        | Response Message       |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| CreateFaculty   | `CreateFacultyRequest` | `FacultyResponse`      |
| GetFaculty      | `GetFacultyRequest`    | `FacultyResponse`      |
| UpdateFaculty   | `UpdateFacultyRequest` | `FacultyResponse`      |
| DeleteFaculty   | `DeleteFacultyRequest` | `DeleteFacultyResponse`|
| ListFaculties   | `ListFacultiesRequest` | `ListFacultiesResponse`|

---

## 🧪 Testing with Postman (gRPC)

1. Open Postman → New → **gRPC Request**
2. Enter:
   ```
   localhost:50053
   ```
3. Import `proto/faculty.proto`
4. Select the `FacultyService` service

### Example: `CreateFaculty`

```json
{
  "name": "Tushar Sahay",
  "email": "tushar@example.com",
  "department": "Computer Science",
  "designation": "Senior Lecturer"
}
```

## 🧠 Developer Notes

- Make sure PostgreSQL is running and accessible with proper credentials.
- If you modify the `.proto` file, regenerate code using:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. proto/faculty.proto
```

- Use `pb.UnimplementedFacultyServiceServer` to avoid gRPC errors for unimplemented methods.

---

## 🔐 Security (Basic)

- Always avoid hardcoding credentials in production
- Use env vars or config file in real deployments

---

## 🙌 Contribution

Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements to the `faculty-service` as part of the broader `eduErp` suite.
